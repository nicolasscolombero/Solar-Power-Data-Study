Solar Power Generation Data Analytics

This project delves into the realm of solar power generation data analytics. It comprises three major sections: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Temporal Trends Analysis, and Correlation Examination.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
The project initiates with EDA, aiming to gain a comprehensive understanding of the dataset. This entails exploring descriptive statistics, variable distributions, and addressing missing data. The analysis covers two datasets: solar generation data and climate data.

Temporal Trends Analysis:
Temporal trends are examined to discern patterns in solar generation over time. This includes investigating seasonal fluctuations and trends across different timeframes (e.g., yearly, monthly, and daily). The analysis of both solar generation and climate variables provides valuable insights.

Correlation Examination:
Correlation matrices are generated to explore the relationships between variables. Key findings include a strong positive correlation between ambient temperature and module temperature, indicating their interdependence. Additionally, irradiation shows a high positive correlation with power generation, signifying its substantial influence.

In conclusion, this project highlights the significance of climate variables and irradiation in solar power generation. It also emphasizes the cumulative nature of total yield, which exhibits limited correlations with daily variables. Explore this project to gain valuable insights into solar power generation dynamics.
